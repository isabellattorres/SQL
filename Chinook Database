WHERE country !='USA'

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

select firstname, lastname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil'

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

select c.firstname, c.lastname,inv.invoiceid, inv.invoicedate,inv.billingcountry

INNER JOIN chinook.customers c

select * from 
chinook.employees
where title='Sales Support Agent'

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

select distinct billingcountry
