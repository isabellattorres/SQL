# For this project, I downloaded Chinook data from Kaggle.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US

select firstname, lastname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country !='USA'

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

select firstname, lastname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil'

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

select c.firstname, c.lastname,inv.invoiceid, inv.invoicedate,inv.billingcountry
from chinook.invoices inv
INNER JOIN chinook.customers c
ON inv.customerid=c.customerid
WHERE inv.billingcountry='Brazil'

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

select * from 
chinook.employees
where title='Sales Support Agent'

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

select distinct billingcountry 
from chinook.invoices

#6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

select invoices.invoiceid, employees.firstname, employees.lastname
from chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers
on customers.supportrepid=employees.employeeid
join chinook.invoices on invoices.customerid=customers.customerid


#7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

elect employees.firstname, employees.lastname, customers.firstname,customers.lastname, customers.country, invoices.total
from chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers
on customers.supportrepid=employees.employeeid
join chinook.invoices on invoices.customerid=customers.customerid

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

from chinook.invoices
where invoicedate between '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31'


#9.What are the total sales for 2009?
select sum(total)
from chinook.invoices
where invoicedate between '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31'
